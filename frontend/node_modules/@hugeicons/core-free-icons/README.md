## Installation

This is a core package that provides the raw icons. To use these icons in your project, you'll need to install both this package and the corresponding framework-specific package:

```bash
# First, install the core package
npm install @hugeicons/core-free-icons

# Then install the framework-specific package
npm install @hugeicons/react          # for React
# or
npm install @hugeicons/react-native   # for React Native
# or
npm install @hugeicons/vue           # for Vue
# or
npm install @hugeicons/angular       # for Angular
# or
npm install @hugeicons/svelte        # for Svelte
```

## Usage

### Import Methods

This package now supports multiple import methods for maximum flexibility:

#### 1. Static Import (Tree-shakeable)
Best for production builds when you know which icons you need:

```javascript
import { Home01Icon, User01Icon } from '@hugeicons/core-free-icons';
```

#### 2. Dynamic Import - Full Bundle
Loads the entire icon library (use when you need many icons dynamically):

```javascript
const { Home01Icon } = await import('@hugeicons/core-free-icons');
```

#### 3. Dynamic Import - Individual Icons (NEW âœ¨)
Loads only the specific icon you need (99% smaller bundle size):

```javascript
// Loads just ~0.75KB instead of ~5MB!
const icon = await import('@hugeicons/core-free-icons/Home01Icon');
const Home01Icon = icon.default;
```

### Performance Comparison

| Import Method | Bundle Size | Load Time | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Static Import | ~2-3KB per icon | 0ms (bundled) | Production builds |
| Dynamic Full Bundle | ~5MB | 100-200ms | Many dynamic icons |
| Dynamic Individual | ~0.75KB | 10-20ms | Icon pickers, lazy loading |

For real-world applications, we recommend using our framework-specific packages that provide optimized components and additional features. Check out the Framework Support section below for more details.

## Tree-Shaking Support

This package is optimized for tree-shaking with modern bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, Vite, etc.). When you import icons using the standard syntax, bundlers will automatically eliminate unused icons:

```javascript
// Only the icons you import will be included in your bundle
import { UserIcon, HomeIcon } from '@hugeicons/core-free-icons';

// Bundlers automatically tree-shake unused icons
// Result: Only UserIcon and HomeIcon (~1.5KB) instead of entire library (~5MB)
```

**Requirements for tree-shaking:**
- Use a modern bundler (Webpack 5+, Rollup, Vite, Parcel)
- Ensure your bundler has tree-shaking enabled
- The package automatically sets `sideEffects: false` for optimal tree-shaking
