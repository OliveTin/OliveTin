## Use cases

**Safely** give access to commands, for less technical people;

* eg: Give your family a button to `podman restart plex`
* eg: Give junior admins a simple web form with dropdowns, to start your custom script. `backupScript.sh --folder {{ customerName }}`
* eg: Enable SSH access to the server for the next 20 mins `firewall-cmd --add-service ssh --timeout 20m`

**Simplify** complex commands, make them accessible and repeatable;

* eg: Expose complex commands on touchscreen tablets stuck on walls around your house. `wake-on-lan aa:bb:cc:11:22:33`
* eg: Run long-lived commands on your servers from your cell phone. `dnf update -y`
* eg: Define complex commands with lots of preset arguments, and turn a few arguments into dropdown select boxes. `docker rm {{ container }} && docker create {{ container }} && docker start {{ container }}`

## Features

* **Responsive, touch-friendly UI** - great for tablets and mobile
* **Super simple config in YAML** - because if it's not YAML now-a-days, it's not "cloud native" :-)
* **Dark mode** - for those of you that roll that way.
* **Accessible** - passes all the accessibility checks in Firefox, and issues with accessibility are taken seriously.
* **Container** - available for quickly testing and getting it up and running, great for the selfhosted community.
* **Integrate with anything** - OliveTin just runs Linux shell commands, so theoretially you could integrate with a bunch of stuff just by using curl, ping, etc. However, writing your own shell scripts is a great way to extend OliveTin.
* **Lightweight on resources** - uses only a few MB of RAM and barely any CPU. Written in Go, with a web interface written as a modern, responsive, Single Page App that uses the REST/gRPC API.
* **Good amount of unit tests and style checks** - helps potential contributors be consistent, and helps with maintainability.
