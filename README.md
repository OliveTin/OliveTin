## Use cases

**Safely** give access to commands, for less technical people;

* eg: Give your family a button to `podman restart plex`
* eg: Give junior admins a simple web form with dropdowns, to start your custom script. `backupScript.sh --folder {{ customerName }}`
* eg: Enable SSH access to the server for the next 20 mins `firewall-cmd --add-service ssh --timeout 20m`

**Simplify** complex commands, make them accessible and repeatable;

* eg: Expose complex commands on touchscreen tablets stuck on walls around your house. `wake-on-lan aa:bb:cc:11:22:33`
* eg: Run long-lived commands on your servers from your cell phone. `dnf update -y`
* eg: Define complex commands with lots of preset arguments, and turn a few arguments into dropdown select boxes. `docker rm {{ container }} && docker create {{ container }} && docker start {{ container }}`

## Features

* **Responsive, touch-friendly UI** - great for tablets and mobile
* **Super simple config in YAML** - because if it's not YAML now-a-days, it's not "cloud native" :-)
* **Dark mode** - for those of you that roll that way.
* **Accessible** - passes all the accessibility checks in Firefox, and issues with accessibility are taken seriously.
* **Container** - available for quickly testing and getting it up and running, great for the selfhosted community.
* **Integrate with anything** - OliveTin just runs Linux shell commands, so theoretially you could integrate with a bunch of stuff just by using curl, ping, etc. However, writing your own shell scripts is a great way to extend OliveTin.
* **Lightweight on resources** - uses only a few MB of RAM and barely any CPU. Written in Go, with a web interface written as a modern, responsive, Single Page App that uses the REST/gRPC API.
* **Good amount of unit tests and style checks** - helps potential contributors be consistent, and helps with maintainability.

## Documentation

All documentation can be found at http://docs.olivetin.app . This includes installation and usage guide, etc.

### Quickstart reference for `config.yaml`

This is a quick example of `config.yaml` - but again, lots of documentation for how to write your `config.yaml` can be found at [the documentation site.](https://docs.olivetin.app)

* (Recommended) [Linux package install (.rpm/.deb)](https://docs.olivetin.app/install-linuxpackage.html) install instructions
* [Container (podman/docker)](https://docs.olivetin.app/install-container.html) install instructions
* [Docker compose](https://docs.olivetin.app/install-compose.html) install instructions
* [Helm on Kubernetes](https://docs.olivetin.app/install-helm.html) install instructions
* [Kubernetes (manual)](https://docs.olivetin.app/install-k8s.html) install instructions
* [.tar.gz (manual)](https://docs.olivetin.app/install-targz.html) install instructions

Put this `config.yaml` in `/etc/OliveTin/` if you're running a standard service, or mount it at `/config` if running in a container.

```yaml
# Listen on all addresses available, port 1337
listenAddressSingleHTTPFrontend: 0.0.0.0:1337

# Choose from INFO (default), WARN and DEBUG
logLevel: "INFO"

# Actions (buttons) to show up on the WebUI:
actions:
  # Docs: https://docs.olivetin.app/action-container-control.html
- title: Restart Plex
  icon: restart
  shell: docker restart plex

  # This will send 1 ping
  # Docs: https://docs.olivetin.app/action-ping.html
- title: Ping host
  shell: ping {{ host }} -c {{ count }}
  icon: ping
  arguments:
    - name: host
      title: host
      type: ascii_identifier
      default: example.com

    - name: count
      title: Count
      type: int
      default: 1

  # Restart http on host "webserver1"
  # Docs: https://docs.olivetin.app/action-ssh.html

  shell: ssh root@webserver1 'service httpd restart'
```
