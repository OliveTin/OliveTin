# OliveTin's AI Policy

## Runtime:

- [x] The project does not include any AI functionality at runtime.
- [x] No data, usage, or similar is sent to, or analyized by AI.

## Development - Contributions

- [x] The project does accept contributions that were written with AI help, but the contribution must be attributed to a human username.
-- [x] The contribution should have come from a freely accessible open source model (coderabbitai pro which the project subscribes to is an exception).
- [x] Contributors should declare when AI has been used to help write contributions.
- [x] The project uses AI as an **optional** part of the PR process (coderabbitai). Please raise any concerns about usage within the PR.
-- [x] Suggestions from coderabbitai can be accepted verbaitem, but ideally it should be the PR author that uses coderabbitai as a guide, who then re-writes the contribution.
- [x] Maintainers are the only agents permitted to accept merges.

## Development - Build process

- [x] Linters, code review tools, and others which are enabled by AI are allowed, but cannot be added as part of the standard build process.

## Community

- [x] Only project admins are allowed to run bots in the community discord server (at the time of writing, the current bot, Japella, is not AI-enabled).
- [x] Support is currently not provided by AI.

## Training

- [x] You may use the OliveTin code base, documentation and repositories to train AI, but obviously usernames and personally identifiable information may not be stored.
