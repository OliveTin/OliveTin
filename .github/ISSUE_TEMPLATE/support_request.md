**What seems to be the problem?!**

If you are getting an error message, then please copy/paste, or better, provide
a screenshot to show us exactly what is wrong.

**Can you provide a sosreport?**

A sosreport really helps us to help you, by providing critical information about your install. If you can generate a sosreport, please copy and paste the output here.

How to generate a sosreport: https://docs.olivetin.app/sosreport.html

**What package/file/container did you use to install OliveTin?**

eg: OliveTin-1234-x86_64.rpm
eg: Container from Dockerhub - please include the version number

**Your config.yaml**

```
Please copy-paste your config.yaml here

You don't need to include anything under "actions:" unless that is where your
error probably is.
```

**OliveTin logs**

If possible, please copy and paste your OliveTin logs from when the error happened.

**Screenshot of WebDeveloper console logs**

If you know how, and if you think it's relevant, a screenshot of the
WebDeveloper console from when you clicked a button is often really helpful.

**Anything else?**

Add any other context about the problem here.
